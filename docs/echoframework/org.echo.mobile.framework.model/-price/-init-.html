<p>The price struct stores asset prices in the Graphene system.</p>
<p>A price is defined as a ratio between two assets, and represents a possible exchange rate
between those two assets. prices are generally not stored in any simplified form, i.e. a price
of (1000 CORE)/(20 USD) is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>The assets within a price are labeled base and quote. Throughout the Graphene code base,
the convention used is that the base asset is the asset being sold, and the quote asset is
the asset being purchased, where the price is represented as base/quote, so in the example
price above the seller is looking to sell CORE asset and get USD in return.</p>
